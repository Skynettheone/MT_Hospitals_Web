# MT Hospitals Website

This project is a basic hospital website created as a group project for the **Esoft Diploma in Information Technology**. The main goal was to build a simple, informative website using primarily HTML and CSS basics, as per the assignment requirements. However, we also explored some advanced CSS and added a few simple functional features to enhance the user experience.

**Note: While we aimed to make the website responsive, there may be some bugs or inconsistencies in responsiveness since we focused on basic techniques rather than industry-standard frameworks or methods for this project.*

## Project Purpose
- **Coursework:** Group project for Esoft Diploma in IT
- **Goal:** Demonstrate web design fundamentals using HTML and CSS
- **Scope:** Basic static website with some extra features for demonstration

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure and content for all pages
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness
  - Custom scrollbars
  - Gradients and overlays
  - Media queries for responsive design
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (social media, navigation, etc.)
- **JavaScript (jQuery)**: For simple interactivity (e.g., sticky navigation bar, toggling classes)

## Unique Features & Enhancements
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to all screen sizes using CSS media queries
- **Custom Navigation Bar**: Sticky/fixed navbar that changes style on scroll and includes a collapsible/hamburger menu for mobile

- **Demonstration-Only Features**: Some features (like doctor channeling, e-pharmacy order) are included to show how they would work, but are not fully functional (no backend)
